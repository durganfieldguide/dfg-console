description: Start of Day - Read handoff and orient for the session
---

Start of Day routine for Dev Team:

1. Read the Dev Team handoff file at `docs/handoffs/DEV.md`
2. Display the full contents so I can review current state
3. Check GitHub for issues labeled `status:ready` + `needs:dev` (ready for development)
4. Check GitHub for any `prio:P0` issues (drop everything)
5. Summarize:
   - Current focus from handoff
   - Issues ready for work
   - Any blockers or gotchas to watch for
6. Ask what I'd like to focus on this session

Do not start any implementation work until I confirm the focus.
